/* 
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Example
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
*/

function uniquePath(m, n) {
  let matrix = Array(m)
    .fill([])
    .map(() => Array(n).fill(1));

  for (let i = 1; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j < matrix[0].length; j++) {
      matrix[i][j] = matrix[i - 1][j] + matrix[i][j - 1];
    }
  }

  return matrix[m - 1][n - 1];
}
